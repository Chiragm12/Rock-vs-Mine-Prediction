# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
The Rock vs Mine prediction project focuses on using machine learning to classify sonar signals as either reflecting off a rock or a mine. This is crucial for naval safety, particularly in detecting underwater mines. The project leverages sonar data, where each entry consists of signal features such as frequency and amplitude.
